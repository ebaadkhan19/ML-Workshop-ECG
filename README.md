- Scikit-learn
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- SciPy

## Model Overview

The ECG anomaly detection model leverages machine learning techniques to identify irregularities in ECG readings. Key features include:

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and normalizing ECG data for analysis.
- **Feature Extraction**: Extracting relevant features from ECG signals for model training.
- **Model Training**: Utilizing algorithms like Random Forest or Support Vector Machine for classification.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Classifying ECG signals as normal or abnormal.

## Installation

To set up this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ebaadkhan19/ECG-Anomaly-Detection.git
2. cd ECG-Anomaly-Detection
