## Introduction

Electrocardiograms (ECGs) are crucial for monitoring heart health. This project aims to develop an effective model for detecting anomalies in ECG signals, which can assist in diagnosing potential heart issues early. The model was deployed as a user-friendly web application using Streamlit.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Streamlit
- Scikit-learn
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- SciPy

## Model Overview

The ECG anomaly detection model leverages machine learning techniques to identify irregularities in ECG readings. Key features include:

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and normalizing ECG data for analysis.
- **Feature Extraction**: Extracting relevant features from ECG signals for model training.
- **Model Training**: Utilizing algorithms like Random Forest or Support Vector Machine for classification.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Classifying ECG signals as normal or abnormal.
